Getting Started
===============

txOAuth is a package for writing OAuth 2.0 enabled applications in Python
using Twisted.

Prerequisites
-------------

txOAuth requires a recent version of Twisted to run.

txOAuth uses Twisted Cred and adapters extensively, and you probably won't
understand much without understanding those two concepts. You should probably
start by reading the `Twisted Cred howto`_ and the `components introduction`_
if you're not yet familiar with those concepts.

.. _Twisted Cred howto: http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/cred.html
.. _components introduction: http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/howto/components.html

txOAuth follows the latest revision of the `OAuth 2.0 specification`_, which
is currently still in draft, as much as possible. Any discrepancy should
probably be reported as a bug.

Getting involved
----------------

txOAuth uses Launchpad for code hosting, and tracking bugs and
specifications. If you would like to get involved (that includes reporting
bugs!), check out the `txOAuth Launchpad page`_.
